# 3dspost

Simple app for posting to masto-api supporting servers.  
Very early version, not intended for serious use.

## Usage

Initial config requires an instance url (including the scheme, e.g. `https://example.tld`) and an oauth bearer token (refer to mastoapi documentation for information on how to obtain it).
